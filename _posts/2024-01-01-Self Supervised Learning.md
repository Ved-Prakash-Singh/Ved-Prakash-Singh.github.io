Broadly, Machine Learning Algorithms can be categorized into below mentioned categories
1. Supervised Learning: In Supervised Learning algorithm, machine needs label (external supervision) to learn the pattern in the input features, so that once trained, the model can predict label for the unlabelled data just based upon input features, using the learned pattern. The label used as external supervision, and during the learning process, machine try to come up with some function which predicts the label with least error. Once, machine has learned then it can predict the label based upon input features.
2. Unsupervised Learning: In Unsupervised Learning algorithm, machine doesn't need label (no external supervision) to learn the pattern. The objective here is different from the objective in Supervised Learning algorithm. In unsupervised learning, the optimization process is driven by the algorithm's specific goals, whether it's grouping similar data points, capturing important features, generating realistic samples, or estimating underlying distributions. The absence of explicit labels makes the optimization more focused on the intrinsic properties of the data rather than error with respect to labeled targets.
   Below mentioned are some example of Unsupervised Learning algorithms -
   a. Clustering Algorithms
   b. Dimensionality Reduction
   c. Association Rule Learning
   d. Density Estimation
3. Semisupervised Learning: In semi-supervised learning, the training dataset consists of a combination of labeled and unlabeled examples. The primary goal is to leverage the information contained in both labeled and unlabeled data to improve the performance of a machine learning model.

4. Reinforcement Learning: In reinforcement learning, agent (model) learns to make sequences of decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or punishments based on the actions it takes, and its goal is to learn a strategy, known as a policy, that maximizes the cumulative reward over time. Reinforcement learning is inspired by how humans and animals learn from trial and error to achieve goals in dynamic and uncertain environments. Popular Reinforcement Learning algorithms include Q-Learning, Deep Q Networks (DQN), Policy Gradient methods, and Actor-Critic methods.
   
5. Self-supervised Learning
