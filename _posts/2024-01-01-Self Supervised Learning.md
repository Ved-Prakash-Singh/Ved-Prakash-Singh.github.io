title: Type of Machine Learning Algorithms
---

Broadly, Machine Learning Algorithms can be categorized into below mentioned categories
1. Supervised Learning
   In Supervised Learning algorithm, machine needs label to learn the pattern in the input features. The label used as external supervision, and during the learning process, machine try to come u with some function which predicts the label with least error. Once, machine has learned then it can predict the label based upon input features.
3. Unsupervised Learning
   
5. Semi-supervised Learning
6. Reinforcement Learning
